# MaxJobOffers Codebase Reorganization Summary

## Overview

We've begun reorganizing the MaxJobOffers codebase to follow a feature-based architecture. This approach organizes code by business domain rather than technical concerns, making the codebase more maintainable and scalable.

## Progress So Far

We've created the following feature directories and moved components into them:

### Interview Feature
- Created `/src/features/interview/components/` directory
- Moved components:
  - `InterviewPrepDashboard.tsx`
  - `InterviewPrepViewer.tsx`
  - `InterviewPrepGenerator.tsx`
- Moved AI prompts:
  - `interviewPrompts.ts`

### Job Feature
- Created `/src/features/job/components/` directory
- Moved components:
  - `JobSearchFilters.tsx`
  - `JobCard.tsx`
  - `JobSearchBoard.tsx`
  - `JobTrackingDashboard.tsx`
  - `JobTrackingCard.tsx`

### LinkedIn Feature
- Created `/src/features/linkedin/components/` directory

  - `SectionSelector.tsx`
  - `ContentEditor.tsx`
  - `PromptWindow.tsx`

  - `IndustryInput.tsx`
  - `UploadArea.tsx`

### Resume Feature

### Events Feature
- Created `/src/features/events/components/` directory
- Moved components:
  - `UpcomingEvents.tsx`

### Dashboard Feature
- Created `/src/features/dashboard/components/` directory
- Moved components:
  - `Dashboard.tsx`
  - `DashboardContainer.tsx`
  - `ResourcesAndEventsContainer.tsx`

### Retirement Feature
- Created `/src/features/retirement/components/` directory
- Moved components:

## Next Steps

1. Update imports in all moved files to reflect the new file paths
2. Move service files to their respective feature directories
3. Move type definitions to their respective feature directories
4. Update tests to reflect the new file structure
5. Create index.ts files in each feature directory to export components
6. Update the main App.tsx file to import from the new feature directories
