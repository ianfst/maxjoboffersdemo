# MaxJobOffers Project Reorganization Plan

This directory contains a comprehensive plan for reorganizing the MaxJobOffers project structure to improve maintainability, scalability, and code organization.

## Documents

### 1. [Summary](./summary.md)

A high-level overview of the reorganization plan, including:
- Current structure issues
- Benefits of reorganization
- Key changes
- Implementation approach
- Directories to remove

This is the best place to start for a quick understanding of the proposed changes.

### 2. [Structure](./structure.md)

Detailed description of the proposed new structure, including:
- Complete directory structure
- Explanation of each directory's purpose
- Directories to remove or consolidate
- Benefits of the new structure

### 3. [File Mapping](./file-mapping.md)

A comprehensive mapping of current files to their new locations, organized by:
- Components
- Services and logic
- AI files
- Types
- Tests
- Utils and mocks
- Actions
- Scripts

This document serves as a reference during the migration process.

### 4. [Implementation Guide](./implementation-guide.md)

Step-by-step instructions for implementing the reorganization, including:
- Prerequisites
- Implementation steps in phases
- How to update imports and merge files
- Testing and validation
- Clean-up procedures
- Troubleshooting common issues

## How to Use These Documents

1. Start with the [Summary](./summary.md) to understand the overall plan
2. Review the [Structure](./structure.md) to see the proposed directory structure
3. Use the [File Mapping](./file-mapping.md) as a reference for where each file should go
4. Follow the [Implementation Guide](./implementation-guide.md) to execute the reorganization

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Create a new branch** before starting the reorganization
2. **Back up the project** to ensure you can revert if needed
3. **Follow the phases** outlined in the implementation guide
4. **Test thoroughly** after each phase
5. **Update one file at a time** to avoid overwhelming merge conflicts
6. **Use search and replace** for updating import paths
7. **Commit frequently** with descriptive messages

## Benefits of This Reorganization

- **Feature-Centric Organization**: Code is organized by feature rather than technical role
- **Reduced Nesting**: Flatter directory structure with fewer levels of nesting
- **Improved Discoverability**: Easier to find related code since it's grouped by feature
- **Better Scalability**: New features can be added without creating deep nesting
- **Clearer Boundaries**: Clear separation between UI components and business logic
- **Consolidated Types**: Type definitions are consolidated and organized by feature
- **Simplified Imports**: Shorter and more intuitive import paths
- **Better Test Organization**: Tests are organized by feature and type
